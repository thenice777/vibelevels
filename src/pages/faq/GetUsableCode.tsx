      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gradient mb-4">The Problem</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
        AI coding tools often generate significant output, but much of it may not be immediately usable. 
        It can take numerous iterations, wasting time and effort before reaching code that actually works for your needs.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Start with a Blueprint Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Before asking for complete implementation, request a high-level approach:
      </p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Before generating any code, explain the architecture and approach you would take to build [your project]. 
          Outline the main components, data flow, and key functions."
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        This helps you validate the direction before investing time in detailed code that might be off-track.
      </p>
      
      <h3>2. Use Staged Development</h3>
      <p>
        Instead of asking for an entire solution at once, break it down:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, request the core data structures and interfaces</li>
        <li>Then, ask for the main functionality implementation</li>
        <li>Finally, request error handling, edge cases, and refinements</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>For example:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Let's build this application step by step. First, please define the key data structures 
          and interfaces we'll need for a task management system."
        </code>
      </pre>
      
      <h3>3. Provide Clear Constraints and Examples</h3>
      <p>Specify constraints like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Technology stack requirements</li>
        <li>Performance considerations</li>
        <li>Style preferences</li>
        <li>Edge cases to handle</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Include examples when possible:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Generate a user authentication system using React and Firebase. It should handle email/password 
          login similar to this example: [your example]."
        </code>
      </pre>
      
      <h3>4. Use the "Skeleton First" Technique</h3>
      <p>Ask for a functional skeleton before detailed implementation:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Create a working skeleton of this application with minimal features but complete structure. 
          Don't implement detailed business logic yetâ€”focus on getting a functioning framework."
        </code>
      </pre>
      
      <h3>5. Request Self-Review Before Finalization</h3>
      <p>Before accepting code, ask the AI to review its own work:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Before we finalize this solution, please review your code for potential issues, edge cases, 
          or performance problems. Identify any parts that might need improvement."
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>This often catches problems before you waste time implementing flawed solutions.</p>
      
      <h3>6. Quick Implementation Tips:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Set a clear output format (e.g., "Provide the code as a complete file with imports")</li>
        <li>Specify naming conventions upfront to avoid renaming later</li>
        <li>Ask for comments on complex sections to aid understanding</li>
        <li>Request test cases alongside implementation for immediate validation</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
      <p>
        The fastest path to usable code is a structured approach that validates direction before diving into details. 
        This front-loaded planning dramatically reduces wasted iterations.
      </p>
