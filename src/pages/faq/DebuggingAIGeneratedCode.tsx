      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gradient mb-4">The Problem</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
        When AI-generated code doesn't work as expected, debugging can be particularly challenging 
        because you might not fully understand the implementation details or the AI's reasoning.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Avoid "Vibe Debugging"</h3>
      <p>
        Don't simply ask the AI to fix bugs without understanding the issue yourself:
      </p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          ‚ùå "The code doesn't work, please fix it."
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>This leads to endless loops of problems and patches. Instead, take a systematic approach.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Request Explanation Before Fixes</h3>
      <p>Ask the AI to explain how the code works before attempting fixes:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Before we fix this issue, please explain how this code works line by line, 
          particularly the [problematic function]."
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>This builds your understanding and often helps the AI identify the issue during explanation.</p>
      
      <h3>3. Use Incremental Testing</h3>
      <p>Break down the code into testable chunks:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Let's debug this step by step. Can you modify the code to log intermediate 
          results after each major operation?"
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Then test each part separately to isolate the problem.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Implement Explicit State Tracking</h3>
      <p>For complex logic, add state tracking:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>{`"Please modify this code to track the state at each step using console.log statements that show:
1. The current values of key variables
2. Which condition branches are being taken
3. When functions are being called and with what parameters"`}</code>
      </pre>
      
      <h3>5. Ask for Test Cases</h3>
      <p>Request test cases that should pass if the code works correctly:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Please provide 3-5 test cases that would verify this code is working correctly, including edge cases."
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Then run these tests to pinpoint failures.</p>
      
      <h3>6. Seek Alternative Implementations</h3>
      <p>If debugging becomes too complex, ask for a different approach:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Instead of fixing this implementation, could you suggest an alternative approach 
          that accomplishes the same goal but with different logic?"
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Sometimes starting fresh is more efficient than fixing complex bugs.</p>
      
      <h3>7. Use the "Minimal Reproduction" Technique</h3>
      <p>Reduce the code to the smallest version that still shows the problem:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Can you create a minimal version of this code that still demonstrates the same issue? 
          Remove any parts not directly related to the bug."
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>This makes the problem more obvious and easier to fix.</p>
      
      <h3>8. Expert Debugging Workflow</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Understand:</strong> Have the AI explain the code's intended behavior</li>
        <li><strong>Isolate:</strong> Add logging to identify where behavior diverges from expectations</li>
        <li><strong>Hypothesize:</strong> Form theories about what might be causing the issue</li>
        <li><strong>Test:</strong> Modify the code to test each hypothesis</li>
        <li><strong>Fix:</strong> Apply the solution based on confirmed hypothesis</li>
        <li><strong>Verify:</strong> Test the fix with multiple inputs and edge cases</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
      <p>
        Effective debugging of AI-generated code requires building your understanding first, 
        then systematically isolating issues. Avoid the temptation of "vibe debugging" where 
        you simply ask the AI to fix problems without gaining insight into the underlying issues.
