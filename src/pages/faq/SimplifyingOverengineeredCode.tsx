      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gradient mb-4">The Problem</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
        AI tools often generate unnecessarily complex "textbook-perfect" solutions that are overkill 
        for your actual needs, making the code harder to maintain and understand.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Solutions</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Request Simpler Alternatives Explicitly</h3>
      <p>
        When provided with complex code, ask directly for simplification:
      </p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "That solution seems more complex than necessary for our needs. Can you provide a simpler version 
          that accomplishes the same goal with less code and fewer abstractions?"
        </code>
      </pre>
      
      <p>Or be specific about the simplification:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>{`"Please simplify this solution by:
1. Reducing the number of abstraction layers
2. Combining related functions
3. Using native JavaScript methods instead of creating custom utilities"`}</code>
      </pre>
      
      <h3>2. Set Complexity Constraints Upfront</h3>
      <p>Before the AI generates code, specify complexity constraints:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>{`"Please implement a form validation solution that:
1. Uses no more than 2-3 functions
2. Doesn't require external libraries
3. Prioritizes readability over abstract patterns"`}</code>
      </pre>
      
      <h3>3. Ask for Explanation Before Implementation</h3>
      <p>Request an explanation of the approach before seeing the full code:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Before writing any code, explain in simple terms how you would implement this feature, 
          focusing on a minimalist approach."
        </code>
      </pre>
      
      <p>If the explanation sounds complex, redirect before getting the actual code:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "That approach seems more complex than needed. Could you suggest a more straightforward 
          solution before implementing it?"
        </code>
      </pre>
      
      <h3>4. Use Specific Anti-Patterns to Avoid</h3>
      <p>Identify patterns you want to avoid:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>{`"Please implement this without using:
1. Complex class hierarchies
2. The observer pattern
3. Factory functions
4. Singleton patterns"`}</code>
      </pre>
      
      <h3>5. Request Progressive Complexity</h3>
      <p>Ask for the simplest version first, then add complexity only as needed:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "Start with the most basic implementation that works. We can add complexity later if necessary."
        </code>
      </pre>
      
      <p>When reviewing the simple version:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>
          "This looks good. Now let's add error handling, but keep the core logic just as simple."
        </code>
      </pre>
      
      <h3>6. Compare Alternatives Side-by-Side</h3>
      <p>Ask for multiple approaches with different complexity levels:</p>
      <pre className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-md overflow-auto text-sm">
        <code>{`"Can you provide three alternative implementations of this feature:
1. A simple procedural version
2. A moderate object-oriented version
3. A more functional programming approach

Explain the trade-offs of each approach."`}</code>
      </pre>
      
      <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
      <p>
        The most effective strategy is setting simplicity constraints upfront and asking for explanation 
        before implementation. For existing complex code, request explicit simplification with defined parameters. 
        Remember that it's easier to add complexity later than to simplify an overengineered solution.
